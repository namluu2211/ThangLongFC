# ⚽ Thăng Long FC - Mia Professional Football Club Management System

## 🚀 Overview

**Thăng Long FC** is a comprehensive Angular-based football club management system designed for local football clubs to manage players, matches, finances, and statistics. The application has evolved from a simple skeleton into a professional-grade system with advanced core services and AI-powered features.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Player Management**
- Complete player profiles with avatars and statistics
- AI-powered team balancing algorithms
- Performance tracking and analytics
- Position management and skill assessments
- Drag-and-drop team formation interface

### ⚽ **Match Management**
- Comprehensive match creation and tracking
- Real-time score updates and match events
- Automatic financial calculations
- Goal, assist, and card tracking
- Match result analysis and reporting

### 💰 **Financial Management**
- Real-time fund tracking and monitoring
- Automatic revenue calculations (winner/loser fees, penalties)
- Detailed expense management (referee, field, water, etc.)
- Profit/loss analysis and reporting
- Financial timeline visualization

### 📊 **Advanced Statistics & Analytics**
- AI-powered player performance analysis
- Team composition recommendations
- Monthly and yearly comparison reports
- Predictive team balancing
- Comprehensive financial analytics
- Performance trend analysis
- Experimental balance score metric (stats.balanceScore) assessing positional distribution & contribution consistency.
 - Enhanced team balance composite scoring (size, skill variance, experience parity, position diversity).

#### Team Balance Composite
The service computes a richer balance analysis:
```
sizeScore                # Player count parity (penalizes >1 diff)
skillVarianceScore       # Lower variance in per-player (goals+assists) proxy => higher score
experienceParityScore    # Difference in avg totalMatches between teams (lower diff => higher score)
positionDiversityScore   # Unique positions across combined teams (scaled)
balanceScore             # Legacy simple size-based score
balanceScoreFinal        # Weighted composite (size 30%, skill variance 25%, experience 25%, position diversity 20%)
```
Recommendations adapt to low component scores (e.g. redistribute skill, swap experienced players, increase position diversity). Use `MatchService.getTeamBalance(...)` to access composite metrics.

##### Swap Suggestions & Caching
`PlayerService` now memoizes team balance computations using a sorted player ID key. This reduces recalculation overhead when the same roster is evaluated repeatedly (e.g. during UI drag-and-drop). Cache auto-invalidates on any player CRUD operation.

Additionally, a lightweight swap optimization heuristic evaluates cross-team player exchanges (top 15 per side) and returns up to 5 beneficial swaps with projected composite score gain:
```
swapSuggestions: [
	{
		fromTeam: 'A',            # Origin team of the player being swapped out
		playerOutId: string,      # Player leaving team A
		playerInId: string,       # Player entering team A from team B
		expectedGain: number,     # Increase in balanceScoreFinal if swap applied
		rationale: string         # Human-readable explanation
	}, ...
]
```
Access via `MatchService.getTeamBalance(teamA, teamB)` which now includes `swapSuggestions` in the observable result.
Heuristic Factors Recomputed Per Swap:
- Size parity
- Skill variance (goals + assists proxy)
- Experience parity (avg totalMatches)
- Position diversity

Future enhancements may include multi-swap optimization or role-specific balancing.

### 📋 **Match History**
- Complete match archive with search and filtering
- Editable match data (admin only)
- Financial breakdown for each match
- Export capabilities for data backup
- Firebase synchronization with offline support

### Realtime Player & Avatar Migration

You can migrate local player data (`src/assets/players.json`) and avatar images (`src/assets/images/avatar_players/`) into Firebase Realtime Database and Storage using the script: `scripts/migrate-players.js`.

Realtime DB nodes created:
```
/players/{id}           # Player profile & stats (+ avatarURL, avatarChecksum if available)
/playerAvatars/{id}     # Avatar metadata (checksum, fileName, storagePath, downloadURL, updatedAt, currentVersion?, versions?)
/playerMedia/{playerId}/{mediaId} # Gallery media items (type, checksum, storagePath, downloadURL, createdAt)
```

Avatar Storage path pattern:
```
avatars/{md5Checksum}.{ext}
```

Script flags:
| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| --service-account=path | Path to Firebase service account JSON (required for remote writes) |
| --dry | Dry run (no writes) for verification |
| --force | Overwrite existing nodes/files |
| --realtime-only | Skip Firestore logic (future extension) |
| --avatars-node | Write `/playerAvatars/{id}` metadata entries |
| --debug | Verbose diagnostic logging |
| --gallery-dir=path | Directory of additional gallery images to ingest |
| --media-node | Enable writing gallery media entries under /playerMedia |
| --avatar-versioning | Enable avatar version history storage under versions/ |

Example (PowerShell):
```powershell
node scripts/migrate-players.js --service-account=./service-account.json --avatars-node --debug
```

Dry run first:
```powershell
node scripts/migrate-players.js --service-account=./service-account.json --avatars-node --dry --debug
```

Force overwrite:
```powershell
node scripts/migrate-players.js --service-account=./service-account.json --avatars-node --force
```

Incremental avatar metadata only:
```powershell
node scripts/migrate-players.js --service-account=./service-account.json --avatars-node
```

Runtime sync: `PlayerService` automatically writes to Realtime DB if Firebase config is valid. Updating a player's avatar URL updates both `/players/{id}` and `/playerAvatars/{id}`. Deleting a player removes both nodes (Storage file retained for safety).

Recommended workflow:
1. Place service account JSON at project root (e.g., `service-account.json`).
2. Run a dry migration.
3. Run actual migration with `--avatars-node`.
4. Start dev server and verify nodes in Realtime DB.
5. Use the app UI for ongoing CRUD; metadata stays in sync.
6. (Optional) Add gallery media programmatically via `PlayerService.addGalleryMedia(playerId, { downloadURL, fileName, checksum })` after uploading image to Storage.

### Avatar Versioning & Gallery
When `--avatar-versioning` is used during migration or an avatar is updated at runtime, the node structure becomes:
```
playerAvatars/{id} {
	playerId: string,
	currentVersion: 'v<timestamp>',
	versions: {
		v<timestamp>: { downloadURL, checksum?, storagePath?, updatedAt }
	},
	updatedAt: ISOString
}
```

Gallery items (written with `--media-node` or via service method):
```
playerMedia/{playerId}/{mediaId} {
	mediaId: string,
	playerId: string,
	fileName: string,
	downloadURL: string,
	checksum?: string,
	type: 'gallery',
	createdAt: ISOString
}
```

Client-side avatar updates automatically append a new version entry under `versions/` with a generated timestamp key.

## 🔧 Technical Features

### Performance Optimizations
- **Reactive Programming**: RxJS-based data flow
- **Intelligent Caching**: Memoization and cache management
- **Lazy Loading**: On-demand component loading
- **Change Detection**: Optimized Angular change detection strategy
 - **Dynamic Imports**: Firebase SDK & AI/drag-drop modules loaded only when needed
 - **Bundle Decomposition**: Players feature split into shell vs. lazy heavy chunk reducing initial load ~33%
 - **Service Extraction**: Finance logic moved to `MatchFinanceService` minimizing component state
 - **AI Debounce & Caching**: Team composition hash prevents redundant analysis runs
 - **Environment-Gated Logging**: Production build excludes verbose dev logs
 - **Pagination Memoization**: Avoids slice/recalc until state changes
 - **AI Service Caching**: Single dynamic instance of `AIAnalysisService` reused (no repeated imports)
 - **Firebase Core Split**: Initialization separated into `FirebaseCoreService` reducing duplication and enabling future granular lazy loading of feature data listeners.
	- **Deferred Listeners**: History, Fund, and Statistics Firebase listeners now attach only when their lazy routes mount (reduces idle realtime overhead).
	- **Analysis Route Extraction**: `/analysis` lazy route hosts AI logic; players route no longer carries AI code unless explicitly loaded.
	- **Web Worker Offload**: Heavy AI computations moved to `ai-analysis.worker.ts` via `AIWorkerService`, keeping main thread responsive.
	- **Future Measurement**: Post-refactor bundle size measurement pending (`SIZE-ANALYSIS.md` will be updated after production build).
 - See `SIZE-ANALYSIS.md` for detailed size evolution and next optimization targets.

### 🚦 Phase 3 Enhancements (Runtime Flexibility & Performance Hardening)
Recent architectural improvements focused on reducing write amplification, enabling hot data backend switching, improving observability of performance, and strengthening test coverage.

#### 1. Unified Player Data Facade (Hot-Swappable Backend)
`PlayerDataFacade` now abstracts CRUD across Firebase Realtime Database and local file (`src/assets/players.json`). Switching modes no longer requires a reload; a runtime toggle (Admin Settings Panel) calls `setMode('firebase' | 'file')`, rebuilding subscriptions on-the-fly.

Benefits:
- Zero UI disruption when changing persistence layer
- Simplified mocking in tests (facade stub instead of Firebase internals)
- Offline-friendly development path (file mode + localStorage fallback)

#### 2. Caching Layer (`CacheService`)
Heavy analytics (team, player advanced, fund, comparison) are wrapped with a TTL memoization (default 15s) to avoid redundant recalculations on rapid successive emissions from reactive streams.

Usage pattern:
```ts
const stats = this.cache.wrap('teamAnalytics', 15000, () => this.teamAnalyticsService.calculate(...));
```
Invalidation occurs automatically after TTL or manually via `cache.clear()` (exposed in Admin Settings Panel for dev).

#### 3. Batched Firebase Statistics Sync
Previously, each granular stat update generated an immediate Firebase write. This caused write amplification and potential rate limiting.

Now, a Subject queues stat changes and emits a consolidated batch after a 30s debounce window:
```ts
pendingBatchSubject.next(partialStats);
```
The merged batch (with `batchType` metadata) is flushed via a single Firebase call, reducing network overhead dramatically under active match conditions.

Advantages:
- Fewer concurrent writes
- Reduced contention on realtime listeners
- Clear audit trail per batch

#### 4. Admin Settings Panel
New panel (restricted to admin roles) exposing runtime controls:
- Toggle Data Mode (Firebase ↔ File)
- Enable/Disable AI Analysis
- Export Full Analytics Snapshot (JSON download)
- Manual Flush (forces immediate batch sync)
- Clear Cache

This removes the need for environment rebuilds for common development toggles, accelerating iteration.

#### 5. Aggregated Analytics (`getAllAnalytics()`)
`StatisticsService` exposes a single method bundling all analytics domains (player, team, fund, comparison). Ideal for bulk export and snapshot views, internally leveraging caching to avoid fan-out recalculations.

#### 6. E2E Foundation (Playwright)
Added a lightweight smoke test ensuring the app renders and critical headings / navigation appear. Future scenarios will validate data mode switching and CRUD in both backends.

Run:
```powershell
npm run e2e
```

#### 7. Testing Modernization (Jest)
Converted service-level tests to Jest (ts-jest transform). Simplified configuration & improved developer feedback speed. Coverage enabled (currently ~80–90% on analytics services).

#### 8. Accessibility Improvements
Added ARIA roles (banner, navigation), live regions for loading / error states, labelled interactive elements, and improved keyboard semantics on players & header components.

#### 9. Performance Profiling
Script: `scripts/profile-performance.js` builds with `--stats-json` then prints human-readable bundle metrics (largest assets, total size). Helps target code-splitting & lazy loading candidates.

Run profiling:
```powershell
npm run profile
```
Sample output:
```
Building with stats-json...
Total JS assets: 1.42 MB (uncompressed)
Top 5 largest assets:
	main.[hash].js - 420 KB
	polyfills.[hash].js - 180 KB
	vendors.[hash].js - 610 KB
	players-feature.[hash].js - 130 KB
	analysis.[hash].js - 80 KB
Next Actions:
- Consider splitting vendors chunk (rxjs, firebase)
- Evaluate dynamic import of advanced analytics
```

#### 10. Developer Ergonomics
- Runtime toggles prevent rebuild loops
- Central analytics snapshot simplifies export + external tooling integration
- Explicit profiling path enforces performance culture

#### 11. Future Optimization Targets
- More granular Firebase listeners per feature route
- Async chunk prefetch hints (link rel="prefetch") for frequently navigated lazy modules
- Optional Web Worker migration for additional heavy calculations
- Extended E2E coverage across both data modes

> All Phase 3 core goals (facade, caching, batched sync, admin panel, profiling, accessibility) are implemented; documentation updated here. Remaining optional tasks tracked in project backlog.

### Data Mode Abstraction (Firebase vs. File CRUD)
The system now supports two interchangeable data persistence modes for player management, unified behind a facade pattern:

```
src/app/features/players/services/
├── player-data-facade.service.ts   # Decides active backend & exposes players$ + CRUD
├── file-player-crud.service.ts     # Local file + HTTP dev server CRUD (players.json)
└── firebase-player.service.ts      # Firebase Realtime Database CRUD
```

#### Facade Responsibilities
- Auto-selects data source based on `environment.features.fileCrud` (true = file mode, false = Firebase)
- Exposes a single observable `players$` for UI consumption
- Provides methods: `createPlayer(info)`, `updatePlayer(id, patch)`, `deletePlayer(id)`
- Offers `useFileMode` boolean & `getSnapshot()` for synchronous reads and UI badges

#### Running in File Mode (Local JSON Persistence)
File mode is ideal for rapid local development without a Firebase connection.

1. Ensure dev environment flag is set (already true in `environment.ts`):
	```ts
	export const environment = {
	  /* ... */
	  features: { fileCrud: true }
	}
	```
2. Start the Angular dev server (separate terminal):
	```powershell
	npm start
	```
3. Start the player file CRUD server (second terminal):
	```powershell
	npm run players:file:server
	```
4. CRUD operations now hit `scripts/players-file-server.js` endpoints manipulating `src/assets/players.json`.
5. If the server is unreachable, the facade falls back to a localStorage cache (read-only until connectivity restored).

#### Endpoints Exposed by Dev Server
| Method | Path              | Description                |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| GET    | /players          | Returns all players        |
| POST   | /players          | Creates a new player       |
| PUT    | /players/:id      | Updates an existing player |
| DELETE | /players/:id      | Removes a player           |

IDs auto-increment and are persisted in the JSON file. The server rewrites `players.json` on each mutating request.

#### Switching to Firebase Mode
Set the feature flag to false (or ensure production environment does so):
```ts
export const environment = {
  /* ... */
  features: { fileCrud: false }
}
```
No UI changes required—`PlayerDataFacade` routes calls to `FirebasePlayerService` seamlessly.

#### UI Indicators
`PlayersComponent` shows a badge derived from facade state:
```
[ Data Mode: FILE ]  or  [ Data Mode: FIREBASE ]
```
This makes it explicit which backend is currently powering the list.

#### Migration Notes
- Legacy direct injections of `FirebasePlayerService` have been replaced by the facade.
- `player-crud.service.ts` is deprecated; new code should use only `PlayerDataFacade`.
- The facade maintains a snapshot to avoid eager subscriptions when only a synchronous read is needed.

#### Advantages
- Hot-swappable persistence for faster iteration.
- Reduced coupling between UI and backend specifics.
- Simplified testing (mock facade instead of Firebase internals).
- Resilient offline development via localStorage fallback.

#### Future Enhancements (Planned)
- Add e2e tests for both modes.
- Provide a toggle switch in an admin settings panel to change mode at runtime (dev only).
- Integrate a diff/merge tool to push local file changes back into Firebase.

> NOTE: Ensure the file CRUD dev server is NOT deployed to production. It is strictly a development convenience.
